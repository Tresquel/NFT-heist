# NFT Heist

This python script downloads 50 random NFTs from OpenSea's API. (50 is the limit.)

Features:
- Downloads 50 random NFTs from OpenSea
- Uses their API so no web scraping
- All in a function so it's easy to integrate into other projects
- Stores the response in a json file

Downsides:
- Max 50 images per run
- Random NFTs
- No collection downloading (can do that tho with another thingy in the url)
- Crashes with SVGs, slashes, backslashes and probably other things that I haven't encountered yet
- Only for Linux (maybe Mac too, I don't have a machine to test that with)
- Kinda useless

**Note:** I'm not a pro at Python so the code won't be super good or be reliable.
